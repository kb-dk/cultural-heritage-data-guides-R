# Set Up

This guide will help you get started with downloading and setting up the datasets from the Royal Danish Library for use with our guides.

## Download Files

The datasets used in these guides are available on [LOAR (Library Open Access Repository)](https://loar.kb.dk/home). LOAR is a platform that the Royal Danish Library uses to share the library's open datasets for use in research, in studies, and for the general public. You can download the datasets from LOAR to your computer and use the scripts to get started.

1. Visit [https://loar.kb.dk/home](https://loar.kb.dk/home)
2. Browse or search for the dataset you need
3. Download the dataset to your computer

## Locate Downloaded Files

Once the data has been downloaded, find the files in your download folder (typically `Downloads` on Windows, macOS, or Linux).

## Extract Zip Files

Note whether the data is packaged as zip files. If it is, remember to extract the zip file before proceeding. You can extract zip files using:

- **Windows**: Right-click the zip file and select "Extract All"
- **macOS**: Double-click the zip file
- **Linux**: Use `unzip filename.zip` in the terminal

## Organize Your Data

Move the data to a folder that you can access from your Jupyter Notebook or R project. 

**Important**: Create a new folder for your project data if you haven't already. You can organize it however you prefer, for example:
- Create a `data` folder in your project directory
- Create a dedicated folder for each dataset
- Organize by dataset type or analysis purpose

Make sure the folder path is accessible from your working environment.

## Start Your Development Environment

### For Python/Jupyter Notebook Users

1. **Install Anaconda** (if not already installed):
   - Download and install Anaconda from [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
   - See more about the installation process: [Link to Anaconda installation guide]

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open Anaconda Navigator and click on "Jupyter Notebook", or
   - Open a terminal/command prompt and type `jupyter notebook`

### For R Users

1. **Install R Studio** (if not already installed):
   - Download and install R Studio from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
   - See more about the installation process: [Link to R Studio installation guide]

2. **Launch R Studio**:
   - Open R Studio from your applications or start menu

## Open a New Notebook or Markdown File

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Click "New" → "Python 3" (or your preferred kernel) to create a new notebook
- **R Studio**: Click "File" → "New File" → "R Markdown" to create a new R Markdown document

## Follow the Guides

Once your environment is set up and your data is organized, you're ready to follow the codes in our guides. Each guide provides step-by-step instructions and code examples to help you explore and analyze the datasets.

Start by selecting a guide from the table of contents that matches the dataset you've downloaded, and follow along with the provided code cells.
